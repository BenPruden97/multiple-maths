# Testing Code Validation

Home Page HTML Validation

Most of the errors for my HTML Pages were based on my buttons being displayed within an anchor tag. I kept them this way as I wanted the whoel button to be clickable instead of just the text.

[I used HTML Validator to validate all of my HTML Pages](https://validator.w3.org/)

![Home Page HTML Validation](assets/testing-file-videos-screenshots/home-page-html-validator.png)

Options Page HTML Validation

![Options Page HTML Validation](assets/testing-file-videos-screenshots/options-page-html-validator.png)

Game Over Page HTML Validation

![Game Over Page HTML Validation](assets/testing-file-videos-screenshots/game-over-page-html-validator.png)

Highscores Page HTML Validation

![Highscores Page HTML Validation](assets/testing-file-videos-screenshots/highscores-page-html-validator.png)

[I used CSS Validator to validate my Style.css Sheet](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Style.CSS Sheet Validation

The errors within my CSS validation had nothing to do with my actual style.css sheet and no errors appeared.

![Style.CSS Sheet CSS Validation](assets/testing-file-videos-screenshots/style-css-validator.png)

JavaScript Validation

[I used JSHint to validate my JavaScript files](https://jshint.com/)

There were a lot of errors for using const and let which I ignored and also for missing semi colons which I have updated.
