# Five Development Planes

To be able to design and create a web-based interactive quiz, I must ensure that the quiz is easy navigational between all pages, looks appealing to the user and meets both the user stories and project goals criteria to allow the user to play the quiz without any issues or bugs and for the quiz to work correctly on all device screen sizes. To keep track of this I used the Five Development Planes, which I have described below:

## Strategy

Here is how I broke down the Strategy Development Plane:

* Users:
    * Users that are new to Multiple Maths
    * Users that are currently playing Multiple Maths  
    * User that are returning to Multiple Maths

* Target Audience:
    * Users that love maths/ maths equations
    * Users that love to play a quiz
    * Users that would like to improve on their maths skills/ knowledge
    * Children/ Teeangers

* The quiz will need to ensure that the user can:
    * Play the quiz without any issues, errors or help
    * Easily navigate around the quiz
    * Be able to choose the options the user would like to play the quiz
    * Determine whether the user has selceted the correct or incorrect answer
    * See their score each quiz and save the users highscores
    * Select to reset the options chosen and to play again
    * Contact the developer for any suggestions, issues, problems, errors or help
    * Connect with the developer from the social links in the footer section

With the above strategy options in mind, I have created a strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability for all of the following options:

### Colours used during my development

* ![#D3D3D3 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23d3d3d3-colour.png) - This colour was used as the main background for all pages.
* ![#FAFAFA Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23fafafa-colour.png) - This colour was used as a background as well as text, headings and icon colours
* ![#2F5195 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%232f5195-colour.png) - This is the main colour of my project as it was used the most to style different types of elements
* ![#D40C00 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23d40c00-colour.png) - This colour was used for the play, reset and subtraction buttons within my project
* ![#FF8B3D Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23ff8b3d-colour.png) - This colour was used for the how to play button and buttons within the options.html file
* ![#38761D Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%2338761d-colour.png) - This colour was used for the highscores.html file and buttons within the options.html file
* ![#7C5295 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%237c5295-colour.png) - This colour was used for the contact form button and pop up as well as buttons for the options.html file

### Typography

* The primary font used for my project was Roboto as it is a very clear and easily readable font and as my target audience is children/ teenagers, the readabiliy is very important.
* I used the sans-serif font as my fallback font just incase Roboto was not able to load onto a users computer.

### Images

* The images used within my project or readme file we created by me using powerpoint presentation. I found powerpoint very easy to use and was able to create the images/ screenshots I needed. I also designed my Multiple Maths logo in Powerpoint presentation.

# Multiple Maths Features

## Features to Implement in the Future

There are a few features that the developer would like to implement in the near future:

### The first is a new set of options which will allow the user to choose the difficulty of the questions that they would need to answer.

The three options would be:

* Easy Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of easy difficulty.
* Medium Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of medium difficulty.
* Hard Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of hard difficulty.

### Feature number 2 would allow the user to choose another answer if the first answer they chose was incorrect.

This would allow the user to think again about the question and try to pick the correct answer from the 3 remaining as the first answer clicked would disappear. This would allow the user a second chance but also improve the users maths skills and knowledge.

### Feature number 3 would allow the user to choose between a quiz or input the answer themselves

The user will be able to choose whether they would like to have a multiple choice quiz or just a question and answer box where the user would have to input the answer themselves without any options. This would be better for teenagers or above as they would need to workout the answer in their head or on a piece of paper.

### The last feature would be a global leaderboard of highscores so that the user can see the highscores of other players. This would allow the user to play Multiple Maths for a competitive purpose and could benefit schools as they could have a class leaderboard or school leaderboard for example.
