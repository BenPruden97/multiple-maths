# Five Development Planes

To be able to design and create a web-based interactive quiz, I must ensure that the quiz is easy navigational between all pages, looks appealing to the user and meets both the user stories and project goals criteria to allow the user to play the quiz without any issues or bugs and for the quiz to work correctly on all device screen sizes. To keep track of this I used the Five Development Planes, which I have described below:

## Strategy

Here is how I broke down the Strategy Development Plane:

* Users:
    * Users that are new to Multiple Maths
    * Users that are currently playing Multiple Maths  
    * User that are returning to Multiple Maths

* Target Audience:
    * Users that love maths/ maths equations
    * Users that love to play a quiz
    * Users that would like to improve on their maths skills/ knowledge
    * Children/ Teeangers

* The quiz will need to ensure that the user can:
    * Play the quiz without any issues, errors or help
    * Easily navigate around the quiz
    * Be able to choose the options the user would like to play the quiz
    * Determine whether the user has selceted the correct or incorrect answer
    * See their score each quiz and save the users highscores
    * Select to reset the options chosen and to play again
    * Contact the developer for any suggestions, issues, problems, errors or help
    * Connect with the developer from the social links in the footer section

With the above strategy options in mind, I have created a strategy table (below) to show the importance and viability for all of the following options:

![Strategy Table](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/strategy-importance-table.png)

## Scope

Here is how I broke down the Scope Development Plane in order to align with the Strategy Development Plane above:

* Content Requirements
    * Vibrant and attractive colours
    * Easily readable primary font and backup font
    * Buttons can be clicked on easily for all device screen sizes for user experience
    * Headings and text used can be easily seen on all device screen sizes

* Functionality Requirements
    * Choose the quiz options that the user would like
    * Easily navigate around the quiz
    * Contact developer
    * Connect with developer on social platforms
    * Save Highscores
    * Timer Amount
    * Question Amount
    * Reset button to reset options chosen
    * Play Again button to play the quiz again

* Quiz Requirements
    * Addition questions & answers
    * Subtraction questions & answers
    * Multiplication questions & answers
    * Division questions & answers
    * Multi questions & answers (displays all 4 maths equations questions & answers)
    * Score Counter
    * Question Counter
    * Timer
    * Correct & Incorrect Answer feedback

## Structure

In the Structure Development Plane I have created a hierarchial structure chart to show how the users of Multiple Maths can navigate around the site with ease and effiency, here is my Structure Development Plane:

![Structure Development Plane](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/structure-development-plane.png)

## Skeleton

In the Skeleton Development Plane I created my wireframe mockups using Adobe XD:

### Home Page Wireframes

![Home Page Wireframes](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/home-page-wireframes.png)

## Surface

### Colours used during my development

* ![#D3D3D3 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23d3d3d3-colour-block.png) - This colour was used as the main background for all pages.
* ![#FAFAFA Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23fafafa-colour-block.png) - This colour was used as a background as well as text, headings and icon colours
* ![#2F5597 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%232f5195-colour-block.png) - This is the main colour of my project as it was used the most to style different types of elements
* ![#D40C00 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23d40c00-colour-block.png) - This colour was used for the play, reset and subtraction buttons within my project
* ![#FF8B3D Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%23ff8b3d-colour-block.png) - This colour was used for the how to play button and buttons within the options.html file
* ![#38761D Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%2338761d-colour-block.png) - This colour was used for the highscores.html file and buttons within the options.html file
* ![#7C5295 Colour](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/%237c5295-colour-block.png) - This colour was used for the contact form button and pop up as well as buttons for the options.html file

### Typography

* The primary font used for my project was Roboto as it is a very clear and easily readable font and as my target audience is children/ teenagers, the readabiliy is very important.
* I used the sans-serif font as my fallback font just incase Roboto was not able to load onto a users computer.

### Images

* The images used within my project or readme file we created by me using powerpoint presentation. I found powerpoint very easy to use and was able to create the images/ screenshots I needed. I also designed my Multiple Maths logo in Powerpoint presentation.

## Features to Implement in the Future

There are a few features that the developer would like to implement in the near future:

### Feature Number 1 

Would be a new set of options which will allow the user to choose the difficulty of the questions that they would need to answer.

The three options would be:

* Easy Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of easy difficulty.
* Medium Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of medium difficulty.
* Hard Difficulty - if the user chose this difficulty then the questions in the quiz will be of hard difficulty.

### Feature Number 2 

Would be to have seperate quiz pages for each of the question types instead of there being one page for all question types.

This would give the quiz better functionality but also be able to add more options for each question type. This will also help with the highscores section so that each question type will have its own highscore page with the highscores for that question type only instead of all question types within one highscores page. This will also help with some issues that popped up during the development stage and with some future implementations such as the question difficulties.

### Feature Number 3

Would allow the user to choose between a quiz or input the answer themselves

The user will be able to choose whether they would like to have a multiple choice quiz or just a question and answer box where the user would have to input the answer themselves without any options. This would be better for teenagers or above as they would need to workout the answer in their head or on a piece of paper.

### Feature number 4

The last feature would be a global leaderboard of highscores so that the user can see the highscores of other players. This would allow the user to play Multiple Maths for a competitive purpose and could benefit schools as they could have a class leaderboard or school leaderboard for example.

# Issues & Bugs

I ran into some issues while developing Multiple Maths which I have listed below:

### Issue Number 1:

One issue that I faced within my milestone project was the audio button that read out the current question to the user. All of the question types read out were fine apart from the subtraction question type. Instead of the audio reading (What is number minus number) it reads out (What is number to number). This maybe confusing to the user especially as Multiple Maths is for a younger audience. I tried to find the best way of displaying the question for the audio button to read out the question correctly but was unable to find a solution without messing up the subtraction questions format so I decided to leave the audio button how it is. I did this as I feel that the audio button option benefits Multiple Maths for younger children who may not be able to understand the question or numbers within the question, they are also able to see clearly what the operator for the question is and what question type they chose from the options.html file.

### Issue Number 2:

Another issue that I faced witin my milestone project was the game answer buttons within my options.html file. At first I had the buttons with an onclick and this as a parameter. I then had an event function to display the innerText within the console log. However when I would click on a button, the event function would display all of the window elements within the console. I had to change this as I only wanted the innerText from the buttons. I then removed the onclick function from the buttons and created an event listener for the click of the answer buttons. I was then able to create a function to be able to display the innerText for the buttons and then determine which of the buttons held the correctAnswer for that question. This allowed me to display the correct and incorrect answer classes so the user will then know if they chose the correct answer or not from the classes shown and then be able to move on with the rest of the quiz.

![Timer Issue](https://github.com/BenPruden97/multiple-maths/blob/master/assets/readme-file-images/timer-issue.png)

### Issue Number 3:

The display of the timer has an issue when the timer goes into single digits for the seconds section of the timer. I was able to fix this for the minutes section as the minutes do not go above double digits. To fix this is added an extra 0 within the innerText for the timer section that would display the 0 before the minute chosen. I could not do the same for the seconds section as the seconds go into double digits and would look like this (01:030 instead 01:30). I tried to find a solution online through tutorials and videos but I wasn't able to find the right solution to fix this issue.

### Issue Number 4:

The original idea for the quiz was to have difficulty options so that the user could choose how easy, medium or hard their quiz would be for the question type that they chose within the options.html file. I created easy, medium & hard js files for each question type with objects with the set of questions, answers and correct answers within them. After doing so I found it very difficult as to how I was going to first display that the user had clicked on the question type and to then display the difficulty of questions that the user chose as they were all in different files. I looked online using websites for tutorials and help and spoke to my mentor about this and we decided that it would be best to remove the difficulty section from the project and to cut all of the easy, medium & hard js files for each question type and then copy them all into one js file named additionquestions.js and so on for the rest of the question types. This made the functionality of the quiz a lot easier as the user would then be able to click onto the question type of their choice and then would display all of the questions within that question type js file.

### Issue Number 5:

There is an issue with the highscores part of my project as it does not differentiate between the question types so the highscores for all question types will all be displayed within one highscores page. There was no quick solution for this but this can be fixed by creating a quiz page and highscores page for each question type. This way the user would complete the quiz for the chosen question type and then be taken to that question types highscore page to save their highscore and view all of their highscores recorded for that question type. This will allow the user to see how well they are doing for each question type and determine what questions they need to focus on more in the future. (I have added this issues solution as something to implement in the future).
